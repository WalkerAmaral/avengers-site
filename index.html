                <p class="sobre__texto">Ghost Rider is the name of multiple antiheroes and superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Marvel had previously used the name for a Western character whose name was later changed to Phantom Rider.
                    <br>The first supernatural Ghost Rider is stunt motorcyclist Johnny Blaze, who, to save the life of his father, agrees to give his soul to "Satan" (later revealed to be an arch-demon named Mephisto). At night and when around evil,
                    Blaze finds his flesh consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields blasts of hellfire from his body, usually from his skeletal hands. He eventually learns he has been bonded
                    with the demon Zarathos. Blaze is featured in the Ghost Rider series from 1972 to 1983.
                    <br>The subsequent Ghost Rider series (1990â€“1998) features Danny Ketch as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by ninja gangsters, Ketch comes in contact with a motorcycle that contains the essence of a Spirit of Vengeance.
                    Blaze reappears in this 1990s series as a supporting character, and it is later revealed that Danny and his sister were Johnny Blaze's long-lost siblings. In 2000s comics, Blaze succeeds Ketch, becoming Ghost Rider again. In 2014,
                    Robbie Reyes becomes Ghost Rider as part of the Marvel NOW! initiative.
                    <br>In May 2011, Ghost Rider placed 90th on IGN's "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" list.[1] Nicolas Cage starred as the Johnny Blaze incarnation of the character in the 2007 film Ghost Rider and its 2012 sequel, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.
                    Gabriel Luna and Tom McComas portray the Robbie Reyes and Johnny Blaze incarnations in the fourth season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>
